## Wallpapers

my collection of 1440p+ wallpapers on linux

# Downloading & Installing

Clone the repo;
`git clone https://gitlab.com/ayylmaonade/wallpapers`

cd into the directory;
`cd wallpapers`

Copy everything to your wallpaper directory;
`cp * ~/Pictures/Wallpapers`

To finish up, I'd recommend removing the repo;
`rm -rf wallpapers/`
